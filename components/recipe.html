      Take and rinse your meat, and then mix all of your marinade ingredients
      together. Once you have everything mixed well, go ahead and rub all over
      your cuts of meat. Cover with Saran Wrap and place in the fridge to
      marinade anywhere from 1 to 3 hours.When you are ready to grill, take a
      cast iron skillet and start sauteing your veggies you want to eat on your
      fajitas. I chose a red onion thinly sliced, and a red and orange bell
      pepper, also thinly sliced with a Tbsp of Olive Oil to saute them in.
      (Have your grill set at 350 degrees.)When your onions start becoming
      translucent and you have everything close to ready, it's time to grab
      those marinating skirt steaks and put them on the grill

      Once the steaks are on, close the lid and set your timer for 5 minutes.
      Open the lid, and flip your steaks. This is the part that is fast! After
      10 minutes and the steaks are done, remove them from the grill and cover
      them in foil.
